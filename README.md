### Additional Functionality:

- Copy/save word breakdown chart as an image
- Export history table as a CSV file (semicolon as delimiter), can be loaded back into the calculator or Excel
- Added "Compact" word breakdown option from test version by Gematrinator

### Ciphers:
- Added "Empty" button to disable all active ciphers
- Added "English (special)" cipher category
- Added "Custom" cipher category (English alphabet, fully customizable)
- Added "Russian" cipher category

### Miscellaneous:

- Removed history limit (100 items)
- Phrase is no longer added to history on mouse over ciphers (unfinished phrases cannot be added accidentally)
- History table is automatically updated on cipher toggle
- All available matches found with auto highlighter are displayed in console (debug)
- New option: "Matrix Code Rain" - disable dynamic background if you prefer "classic" gray color background

### More custom ciphers
There is a way to temporarily add multiple properly named and colored custom ciphers.
1. Open the page with "Experimental" calculator in your browser
2. Open "Developer Tools" in browser (press "F12" or "Ctrl+Shift+I")
3. Switch to "Console" tab, paste the code below and press "Enter"
4. A new cipher under "Other" category will be added and it will be available until you reload the page

```
cipherName = "Test Cipher";
ciphCategory = "Other";
R = 190;
G = 190;
B = 126;
lowerCaseValues = [10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31,32,33,34,35];
upperCaseValues = [10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31,32,33,34,35];

// ======================

allCiphers[allCiphers.length] = new cipher(cipherName, "English", R, G, B);
cipherArray[cipherName] = ciphCategory;
allCiphers[allCiphers.length-1].vArr = lowerCaseValues;
allCiphers[allCiphers.length-1].vArr2 = upperCaseValues;
Build_Open_Ciphers();
```
